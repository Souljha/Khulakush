## Twilio WhatsApp Setup

### Step 1: Create a Twilio Account

1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email and phone number

### Step 2: Get Your Twilio Credentials

1. After logging in, go to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** on the dashboard
3. Copy these values - you'll need them for the `.env` file

### Step 3: Set Up WhatsApp Sandbox (For Testing)

**For testing purposes**, you can use Twilio's WhatsApp Sandbox:

1. In Twilio Console, go to **Messaging** > **Try it out** > **Send a WhatsApp message**
2. Follow the instructions to join the sandbox by sending a WhatsApp message to the Twilio number
3. The sandbox number is usually: `whatsapp:+14155238886`
4. You'll need to send a message like "join <your-sandbox-code>" to join

**Important:** In the sandbox, you can only send WhatsApp messages to phone numbers that have joined your sandbox by sending the join code.

### Step 4: Production WhatsApp Setup (For Live Use)

For production, you need to:

1. Apply for WhatsApp Business API access through Twilio
2. Get your own WhatsApp Business number
3. Complete Twilio's verification process
4. This can take a few days to weeks for approval

**Resources:**
- [Twilio WhatsApp API Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api)
- [Request WhatsApp Business Access](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp/request-access)

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with your Twilio credentials:

```env
# Twilio WhatsApp Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-actual-account-sid-from-twilio-console
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-actual-auth-token-from-twilio-console
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=whatsapp:+14155238886
HIGHGROUNDS_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+27XXXXXXXXX
```

**Important Notes:**

- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Get this from Twilio Console dashboard
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Get this from Twilio Console dashboard (keep it secret!)
- `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` - For sandbox: `whatsapp:+14155238886`, For production: your Twilio WhatsApp number
- `HIGHGROUNDS_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` - Highgrounds BLVD's WhatsApp number in format `whatsapp:+27XXXXXXXXX`

**Example for South African number:**
```
HIGHGROUNDS_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+27823456789
```

### Step 6: Test the Setup

1. **Join the Twilio Sandbox** (if using sandbox):
   - From your WhatsApp, send the join code to the Twilio sandbox number
   - Also have the Highgrounds BLVD number join the sandbox

2. **Restart your backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Place a test order**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Select "Delivery" as order type
   - Fill in delivery address
   - Complete the order

4. **Check WhatsApp**:
   - Highgrounds BLVD should receive a WhatsApp message with order details
   - Customer should receive a confirmation message

## Troubleshooting

### WhatsApp messages not sending?

1. **Check your Twilio credentials** in `.env`
2. **Verify both numbers have joined the sandbox** (for testing)
3. **Check backend console** for error messages
4. **Verify phone number format**: Must include country code with `whatsapp:` prefix

### Error: "The number +XXXXXXXXX is not available"

- This means the number hasn't joined your Twilio sandbox
- Send the join code from WhatsApp to activate it

### Orders saving but no notifications?

- Check the backend console for WhatsApp service warnings
- Verify `.env` file has correct Twilio credentials
- Make sure backend server was restarted after updating `.env`
